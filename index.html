                Title was vague to avoid spoilers! So the curse that bound Uma was 'va fail, elaine - caed' mil, folie! glaeddyv dorne aep t'enaid, bunn'droh ithne i'yachus'. But even when they contact Ida, she doesn't translate it, she merely tells Yen how to negate
                it. I am really curious to know what it translates as, can anyone help me out?
